# IntelliQuote: Insurance Quoting Application 🤖 

## 📌 Project Overview

IntelliQuote is a modern, responsive web application designed to quickly generate estimated insurance quotes for users. It provides an intuitive interface for inputting risk factors and coverage needs, calculating an initial premium estimate, and connecting users with next steps.

This application is built using the Node.js runtime environment, utilizing Express.js for routing and server-side logic, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for dynamic views.

## ✨ Features

**Responsive Design:** Accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Dynamic Quoting:** Calculates preliminary insurance quotes based on user input (age, location, coverage level, etc.).

**Data Persistence:** Uses a structured system for storing quote requests and policy data (implied by the data directory).

**Modular Codebase:** Clear separation of concerns with dedicated folders for views, public assets, and data.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Templating: EJS (Embedded JavaScript)

Styling/Frontend: (Assumed CSS/JavaScript in public/js)
